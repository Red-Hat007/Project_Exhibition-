# Project_Exhibition-Do you remember when it wasn't necessary to have a website? When most boards would scoff at the value of running a Facebook page?

The situation now is the same as every time a new platform develops: if you donâ€™t have something your customers can access, you're giving that medium to your competition. At the moment, an automated presence on Google Home or Slack may not be central to your strategy, but those who claim ground now could dominate it in the future.
