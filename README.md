Bots can help you get information about latest happenings around you as soon as they are published.
An example of such bots is: TechCrunch bot.

Revive social connections: Such bots could help people connect to someone they have been looking for, with whom they can converse based on factors like common interests or proximity.
For example: Foxsy, HotBot.

Acts as a concierge: A number of bots may provide you with different services, but you can have only one bot which can perform all the tasks that are needed to be done instead of having individual chatbots for different tasks.
For example: Mezi

For facilitating a rapid, methodical flow of information between doctors and their patients an AI-powered conversational bot called Melody was developed.

HealthTap is the first medical platform on Facebook Messenger that allows you to talk to a doctor instantly. Chatbots keep information about weight or age guidelines, keep the parents informed about their child’s physical and health state.
